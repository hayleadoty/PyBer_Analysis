# PyBer_Analysis
Rideshare Data Analysis from January-May 2019

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of our analysis was to summarize our ride sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) and depict the results in a multi-line graph that shows the weekly fare per city type.

## Results

PyBer Summary DataFrame:

Urban cities show higher volume than other city types in total rides, drivers, and fares, as expected. For urban cities, average fare per ride and driver are lower than the other city types, likely due to driver availability. Suburban cities fall in between urban and rural in terms of all areas. Rural cities show less rides, drivers, and less in total fares, however, rides are more expensive, and drivers make more money per ride. We'd expect to see this result, as the cost per ride is going to be higher where there are less drivers available.

We can see that urban cities are the most profitable for the company overall, which is to be expected. There is a spike in fares for all city types toward the end of February. Overall, we can see that urban cities generate the highest fare overall, with suburban and urban generating less fares, respectively.

## Summary

Knowing what we know about our results, we can make a few business recommendations for addressing disparities between the city types:
- Providing incentives to new drivers in less populated areas, such as sign-on bonuses, could lead to higher driver availability and lower fare rates for customers. This could lead to more overall ride volume and a higher profit for suburban and rural city types.
- Generating promotional codes (such as ride credits) for existing and new customers in suburban and rural city types could lead to higher ride volume.
- Initiating contests for drivers in less popuated areas could lead to increased driver availability. For example, if a driver completes x-amount of rides within a week, they receive a $100 bonus, x-amount of rides within a month, they receive a $250 bonus, and so on.
